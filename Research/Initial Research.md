# Initial Research Topics

## Chatbots
### What is a Chatbot?
A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) piece of software that can dynamically simulate a realistic conversation or response with a user using natural language processing (NLP). 

### How do they work?
There are two types of chatbots – Rule-Based and Self-Learning. [CHATBOT: Architecture, design, & development][1]

With a Rule-Based, the bot can answer questions based on the rules it has be trained with. It will follow a very if/else approach and can seem very robotic and easy to fool. They are used for very simple queries.

With a Self-Learning approach, the bot can dynamically learn from user interaction with machine learning. They are more efficient than Rule-Based bots and can be broken down into two further types (Retrieval Based and Generative)

**Retrieval Based:** The bot determines a response from a list of predefined responses such as a database of conversations using heuristics. The context of the input message is used in the selection and can include information from previous messages (E.g. names, answers etc).

**Generative:** The bot can generate its own answers from a list of predefined responses, rather than taking the most suitable response it forms a reply word by word. This approached can generate the most realistic response if trained correctly but can be more difficult to program.

### What are the uses and benefits?
#### Uses
They are used in devices (Siri, Alexa etc), websites, mobiles apps and through telephone calls.
Today a lot of companies also have chatbots to engage with users for things such as customer service. An example of this is Intercom who use AI chatbots to answer roughly 29% of all users queries before they make it to a human. [Intercom AI Chatbot][2]

#### Benefits
* Save Time
* Save Money
* Provide Greater Customer Satisfaction
* Increase Customer Base
* Cut Down on Errors
* Add Good Humor

### Conclusion
From my research a Retrieval Based Self-Learning chatbot might be most suitable for our project. A predetermined list of responses would be provided that the bot could select from to form it’s reply to the user.

## Digital Twins
### What are Digital Twins?
Digital twins are virtualised replicas of physical devices that can be used to run simulations before actual devices are built and deployed in the real world. [NetworkWorld – What are Digital Twins][3]

The idea was initially proposed with NASA’s full-scale virtual test of space capsules, used to diagnose unforeseen problems in orbit, which eventually gave way to fully digital simulations. [The Digital Twin Paradigm for Future NASA and U.S. Air Force Vehicles][4]

### Benefits of Digital Twins
* Reduced downtime and improved performance
* Improved productivity
* Reduced risk
* Lower maintenance costs by predicting maintenance issues before breakdowns occur
* Faster production times
* Improved customer service

### Conclusion
Our project will be used as a Digital Twin to provide a simulation of a training experience without having to physically hire actors, the Luas etc. This will cut down costs, risk, and deployment time.

## Gamification
Definition:
The application of typical elements of game playing (e.g. point scoring, competition with others, rules of play) to other areas of activity, typically as an online marketing technique to encourage engagement with a product or service.
Gamification can be applied in many fields such as the workplace, education, heath and even online gambling which could be thought of as a bad thing.

In the workplace, the aim of Gamification is to increase employee productivity by using the characteristics of video games such as cooperative play and point scoring and the likes to give the employees the sense of achievement whilst they are doing their day to day job. Another aspect Gamification is a rewards based system. For an example if an employee scores a high enough score, they are they are rewarded with a real world object. This could give the employee more of a reason to work harder if they are guaranteed a return on their investment of hard work. 

In the online gambling world, gamification is seen as a bad thing. It could be said that these websites or applications are virtualizing peoples money so much so that they become numb to what they are actually gambling away.

In Conclusion, we are still in the infant stages of gamification. It does have its cons in terms of the virtualization of online gambling however, I think to pros far out weigh the cons. The return that these companies will obtain like happier and more productive employees is worth the cost to implement a system in the first place

## Digital Training / VR Training
Virtual reality training is a way of training employees in a 3D virtual space that is more affordable, immersive and safer.
The aim of VR training is to make training more visual and achieve higher engagement and retention rates. If the training simulator is done properly, the employee can be fully immersed in this virtual world. This immersion is what makes their training more memorable and they will retain  information easier.

### VR Training can be done in various different ways:
Mobile: This is the cheapest type of VR. It is done by inserting you mobile device into a VR headset. The application is then run on your mobile device. The disadvantage to this is there are no handheld controllers so it makes the application less immersive.

Standalone: Oculus supply two products, the Oculus Go and the new Oculus Quest which require no cables attached into a desktop. This comes with handheld controllers. However this is less powerful than the Desktop version.

Desktop: Finally this Headset (e.g Oculus Rift, HTC VIVE) is connected to a high-end computer. This would be the most expensive but most immersive because this headset capable of higher resolutions, refresh rates and better graphics.

### Surgery Sims:
VR training is extremely useful in the case of trainee surgeons. These simulators allow the trainee to perform realistic surgery without the need of an actual patient, minimising the risk on a person’s life. It also allows the trainee to be monitored and scored on their skills.

https://virtualspeech.com/blog/how-is-vr-changing-corporate-training:
An example of VR being used successfully in this sector is when the Johnson & Johnson Institute began looking to improve medical training for surgeons. They worked with Osso VR to develop immersive training for doctors to perform operations. The results saw a 230% increase in surgical performance.

Here are some other results I found on another VR surgery simulator:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1422600/
No differences in baseline assessments were found between groups. Gallbladder dissection was 29% faster for VR-trained residents. Non-VR-trained residents were nine times more likely to transiently fail to make progress and five times more likely to injure the gallbladder or burn nontarget tissue. Mean errors were six times less likely to occur in the VR-trained group.

In Conclusion, VR Training is a safe and affordable way to train employees with high engagement and retention rates.
